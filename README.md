# Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **cosine similarity** and the **bag of words** technique. It recommends movies based on a given movie title by analyzing textual features like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and movie overviews.

## Overview

The recommendation system uses the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extract and clean relevant features (genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview) from the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Combine all textual data into a single `tags` column.
3. **Vectorization**: Convert the `tags` column into a numerical format using `CountVectorizer`.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Calculate similarity scores between movies using **cosine similarity**.
5. **Recommendation**: Recommend top 5 movies based on similarity scores.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, which includes:
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Data preprocessing and model implementation)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Feature extraction and similarity calculation)
- **Pickle** (Saving the processed data and similarity matrix)

---

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on a given title.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses textual data to find similar movies.
- **Fast and Scalable**: Precomputed similarity matrix ensures quick recommendations.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Place the dataset files (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`, `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`) in the appropriate directory.

---

## Usage

1. Open the Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE).
2. Run the script to preprocess the data and generate recommendations.
3. Example to get recommendations:
   ```python
   recommend('Gandhi')
   ```

---

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview are cleaned and tokenized.
   - Unnecessary columns are dropped, and text is combined into a single `tags` column.

2. **Vectorization**:
   - The `tags` column is transformed into a numerical feature space using `CountVectorizer` (Bag of Words model).

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Computes the pairwise similarity between all movies.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - For a given movie, fetch the most similar movies based on the similarity scores.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add support for **user-based collaborative filtering**.
- Include more advanced **NLP techniques** like TF-IDF or embeddings.
- Develop a **web interface** for ease of use.

---

## Example

```python
recommend('The Lego Movie')
```

**Output**:
```
The Lego Batman Movie
The Adventures of Tintin
The Iron Giant
Kung Fu Panda
Despicable Me
```
